         <h3>The story of Aurora's arrival</h3>

         <p>Aurora arrived first, she was 8 months old when she came home, she was adopted from the
            animal shelter after having spent a long time in transit in other homes.
            At the beginning of her arrival she was very skittish, and I couldn't pet her until three months
            had passed. After having been around, she had a hard time adapting to her new home, but finally
            she got familiar and we were able to get along better. Today Aurora is a very cuddly and playful
            kitten, and thanks to the arrival of her little sister Lima she was able to function better, be
            calmer and play more.</p>

            <h4>Description</h4>

           <p>Aurora is a loving and lonely kitten. She likes to be calm. Sometimes she can be skittish and 
            prefers to spend time in her hiding place until she gains confidence. When she is very comfortable 
            she likes to ask for pampering and for her fur to be touched gently. His favorite place to rest is 
            on his scratching post looking out the window.</p>
